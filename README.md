# Predator-Prey Model (Mathematica)

This project models how predator and prey populations interact over time using the Lotka-Volterra equations, a classic system of differential equations from ecology.

## 📘 Description

The notebook `KarthikeyanPredatorPrey.nb` simulates population dynamics between two species — a prey (like rabbits) and a predator (like foxes). It explores how population levels rise and fall based on birth rates, death rates, and interaction rates.

## 📊 Features

- Adjustable parameters for growth and interaction rates
- Time-series plots of prey and predator population changes
- Phase plane visualizations of cyclical behavior
- Equilibrium analysis with visuals

## 🔧 Requirements

To open and interact with this model, you'll need:

- **Wolfram Mathematica** or
- **Wolfram Cloud account** (for browser-based execution)

## 📁 Files Included

- `KarthikeyanPredatorPrey.nb`: Main Mathematica notebook
- `KarthikeyanPredatorPrey.pdf`: PDF version for preview
